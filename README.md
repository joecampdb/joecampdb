### Update: A Shift Toward Structural Bioinformatics and AI-Driven Methods

I'm redirecting my primary focus to structural bioinformatics, with an emphasis on developing robust, reusable project scaffolding for protein structure prediction, design, and analysis using modern AI techniques.  
While I remain active in certain areas of genomics and transcriptomics, the majority of new content and projects here will center on structural biology, geometric deep learning, and related tooling.

## About Me
I entered bioinformatics from structural biology and materials science.  
My interests have since broadened to include genomics and transcriptomics, but I am now prioritizing the integration of AI methods with structural problems—particularly protein folding, docking, design, and dynamics.

~~## About Me  
~~I came into bioinformatics from the structural biology and materials science side.  
~~Over time, I’ve become increasingly interested in the broader *-omics* world, especially genomics and transcriptomics — both of which I find beyond useful as well as extraordinarily fascinating.  

I’ve also worked in a computational epigenetics lab, studied neuroscience during my undergraduate years, and developed a habit of digging into how things work at every level — molecules, systems, or code.  

## What I’m Working On  
~~- **IGPXT**: an integrated genomics pipeline and cybernetic marketplace. (Think high-utility wrappers and less so distributed market)  
~~- Exploring **spatial transcriptomics** and **graph neural networks**.
