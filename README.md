### Structural Bioinformatics & AI-Driven Protein Design

I'm a bioinformatics researcher specializing in structural biology, with a focus on developing robust, reusable tooling and scaffolding for protein structure prediction, design, and analysis using modern AI techniques (e.g., geometric deep learning).

While I maintain interest in genomics and transcriptomics, my primary efforts are now centered on structural bioinformatics, protein folding algorithms, and related AI methods.

## About Me

- Background in structural biology, materials science, computational epigenetics, and neuroscience.
- Passionate about understanding systems at molecular, biological, and computational levels.

## What I'm Working On

- 🔭 Developing structural bioinformatics tooling and AI-driven protein design scaffolding
- 🌱 Learning geometric deep learning, manifold learning, and advanced docking/side-chain packing methods
- 🤔 Seeking collaboration on persistent homology and optimization challenges in protein modeling
- 💬 Ask me about protein folding algorithms, geometric deep learning on biomolecules, or AlphaFold variants
- 📫 Reach me: joecamxtc@gmail.com
- 😄 Pronouns: he/him
- ⚡ Fun fact: Humans are about one centimeter taller in the morning than at night due to spinal disc decompression.
