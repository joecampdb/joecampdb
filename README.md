## About Me  
I came into bioinformatics from the structural biology and materials science side.  
Over time, Iâ€™ve become increasingly interested in the broader *-omics* world, especially genomics and transcriptomics â€” both of which I find beyond useful as well as extraordinarily fascinating.  

Iâ€™ve also worked in a computational epigenetics lab, studied neuroscience during my undergraduate years, and developed a habit of digging into how things work at every level â€” molecules, systems, or code.  

## What Iâ€™m Working On  
- **IGPXT**: an integrated genomics pipeline and cybernetic marketplace.  
- Exploring **spatial transcriptomics** and **graph neural networks**.
