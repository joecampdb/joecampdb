### Update: A Shift Toward Structural Bioinformatics and AI-Driven Methods

I'm redirecting my primary focus to structural bioinformatics, with an emphasis on developing robust, reusable project scaffolding for protein structure prediction, design, and analysis using modern AI techniques.  
While I remain active in certain areas of genomics and transcriptomics, the majority of new content and projects here will center on structural biology, geometric deep learning, and related tooling.

~~Strikethrough everything below that no longer applies~~ (because apparently I can’t resist a dramatic markdown flourish)

## About Me
~~I came into bioinformatics from the structural biology and materials science side.~~  
Over time, I’ve become increasingly interested in the broader *-omics* world, especially genomics and transcriptomics — both of which I find beyond useful as well as extraordinarily fascinating.  
~~I’ve also worked in a computational epigenetics lab, studied neuroscience during my undergraduate years, and developed a habit of digging into how things work at every level — molecules, systems, or code.~~  
*…still true, just less relevant when I’m knee-deep in alpha-carbon backbones*

## What I’m Working On
- ~~**IGPXT**: an integrated genomics pipeline and cybernetic marketplace.~~ → archived until further notice  
- ~~Exploring **spatial transcriptomics** and **graph neural networks**.~~ → still love them, but they’re now side quests  
- 🔭 I’m currently working on ... **structural bioinformatics tooling** and **AI-driven protein design scaffolding**  
- 🌱 I’m currently learning ... **geometric deep learning**, **manifold learning**, and why my docking scores hate me  
- 🤔 I’m looking for help with ... **persistent homology** and **someone to tell me if my loss function is crying**  
- 💬 Ask me about ... **folding algorithms**, **side-chain packing tragedies**, or why I have 47 forks of AlphaFold  
- 📫 How to reach me: ... joecamxtc@gmail.com  
- 😄 Pronouns: ... he/him  
- ⚡ Fun fact: ... you are about one centimeter taller in the morning than at night due to spinal decompression — and your proteins are probably misfolded by noon anyway
